# Configuration Reference

Most apps work without extra configuration. When needed, configuration lives under `.webflo/` and/or environment variables.

## Common Areas
- Environment variables via `.env`
- Origins/proxy
- Static assets under `public/`
- Routes under `app/`

See Concepts:
- [Routing](/docs/concepts/routing)
- [Request/Response](/docs/concepts/request-response)
