<!-- /BADGES -->

Webflo is a universal *web*, *mobile*, and *API backend* framework based on vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! It's a powerful little thing written to facilitate building more authentic, web-native applications!

<!--
Here, we've put all of that up for a 20mins straight read!

## Gear Up...

Webflo is a framework on its own track - of working and thinking in vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript! Instead of trying to follow certain patterns that have been touted as "norms", it takes a plunge to draw on native web platform features - plus some more futurisric, fascinating new stuff from across a few web paltforn proposals! This means that to happily meet Webflo, you also have to be excited about the idea of going one step ahead!

**Note** that Webflo is still evolving and some things may change quickly! Careful with *production*! Or, just remember to keep tabs with progress here!

## The Wins...

Much of what eludes the web today!

Introducing...

+ the path of least engineering - with an all-new HTML-first thinking!
+ a focused, standards-based philosophy for building more authentic, web-native applications!

Natively supporting notable new possibilities...

+ a new approach to reactivity that's based on no syntax at all but plain old JavaScript!
+ a new "imports" feature for HTML that makes HTML more reusable!
+ and much more.
